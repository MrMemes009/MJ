<h2>Michael Jackson had vilitigo</h2>

<p>Throughout his youth,Jackson always had a medium-brown complexion
  that was commonly seen in African Americans.  However his skin began
to lighten considerably throughout the 1980s.  He claimed this change in his skin tone was due to
him being diagnosed with vitiligo which would be confirmed through an autopsy
on his body after his death in 2009.</p>
<p> Vitiligo is a vanishingly rare skin disorder that
  causes melanin-producing cells to malfunction and fail.  The precise cause is unknown,
  but it is tied to the autoimmune system. It manifests in splotches and changes in shape over time.
  Jackson bleached his skin with Porcelana in the past, but it's unknown
if the bleaching process was to even out the patches or directly caused the vitiligo.</p>

<h3>Michael Jackson was secretly bald</h3>

<p>Michael Jackson always appeared to have flawless hair. Jackson sported a black afro as a child before
  growing flowing black locks during adulthood.  However, he was forced to wear wigs after 1984.</p>
<p>While filming a Pepsi commercial simulated to look like a live concert,
    Michael caught on fire in a pyrotechnics accident. During the commercial’s sixth take,
    an explosion went off too early, setting Michael’s hair alight. For several moments,
    he continued dancing, not realizing what had happened.</p>
<p>Members of the cast and crew quickly swarmed him and extinguished the flames, but by then, the damage was done.
  He suffered second- and third-degree burns to his face and scalp. To compensate,
  he had his hairline permanently tattooed onto his forehead and wore a wig attached to hair
  that his autopsy called “sparse.” This incident was kept under wraps for 25 years, but was
  leaked by U.S. Weekly in 2009, a move encouraged by Pepsi.
  <h4>He Wanted to be Spider-Man</h4>
  <img src="images/spiderjackson.jpg" alt="spiderjackson" width="225" height="225"/>
  <p>Michael Jackson fancied himself as Spiderman! When Marvel Comics filed for bankruptcy in the 90s, Michael tried to buy the company
  so he could fulfil his dream to play the leading role. However,it didn't go to
  plan and Tobey Maguire stepped up to play Peter Parker instead.</p>
  <p>Ever the optimist, Michael Jackson refused to let his dream of becoming a Marvel superhero go. When the X-Men movie franchise was announced,
    he tried to nab the role as Charles Xavier (aka Professor X). The casting director thought otherwise and
    this later went to Patrick Stewart. </p>
